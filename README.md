This project is about statistical analysis of League of Legends. 
The data contains about 50 thousands rows and is from kaggle:

In this project, I renamed the data file as game.csv for convinience.


Please login your VM and follow the steps in commands.txt, so you can download
all the needed data and files from github and run all containers.

The files are also provided locally in this directory.

The port of jupyter notebook is 8888.
